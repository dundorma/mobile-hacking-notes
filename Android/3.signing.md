# Android Application Signing  

Android developers sign their applications using self-generated (untrusted) keys, meaning there’s no built-in way to verify that an app is genuinely signed by its actual developer.  

### Purpose of Application Signing:  
1. **Simplifies Updates**: Android uses the app’s signature to verify that updates are coming from the same developer.  
2. **Shared User ID**: Apps signed with the same key can run under the same user ID on the platform, enabling them to share data and resources.  
3. **File Replacement**: Developers can instruct Android to replace local files if the new app version is signed with the same key as the previous version.
