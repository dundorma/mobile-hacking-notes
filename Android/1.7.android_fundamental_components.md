# Android Fundamental Components  

Android apps are built using core components that handle different aspects of functionality and user interaction:  

- **Activities**: Represent individual screens that users interact with.  
- **Fragments**: Reusable UI components that can be embedded within Activities.  
- **Intents**: Messaging objects used to start Activities, trigger Broadcast Receivers, or communicate with Services.  
- **Services**: Perform background tasks without a user interface, such as playing music or syncing data.  
- **Content Providers**: Manage and provide access to structured data, allowing data sharing between apps.  
- **Broadcast Receivers**: Respond to system-wide or app-specific events, such as receiving an SMS or detecting network changes.
