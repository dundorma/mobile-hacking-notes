# Encryption  

Encryption encodes all user data on an Android device using symmetric keys, ensuring data is unreadable to unauthorized parties. Android supports two encryption methods: **file-based encryption (FBE)** and **full-disk encryption (FDE)**.  

### File-Based Encryption (FBE)  
Introduced in Android 7.0, FBE allows different files to be encrypted with separate keys that can be unlocked independently. It also supports Direct Boot, enabling quick access to essential features (e.g., alarms, accessibility services) before user credentials are entered.  

### Metadata Encryption  
Starting with Android 9, metadata encryption protects directory layouts, file sizes, and other metadata using a single key managed by Keymaster and protected by verified boot.  

### Full-Disk Encryption (FDE)  
Available from Android 5.0 to 9, FDE encrypts the entire userdata partition with a single key tied to the userâ€™s device password. However, core features like alarms and calls are inaccessible until the user unlocks the device.  

> **Note**: FDE is not allowed on devices running Android 10 and higher. New devices must use FBE.
