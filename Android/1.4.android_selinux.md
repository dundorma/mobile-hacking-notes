# Android SELinux  

Android is configured with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) in enforcing mode to enhance system security.  

### Key Features:  
SELinux uses **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** at the kernel level to regulate access for all processes. This is implemented through a matrix of:  
- **Domains**: Define the context of processes.  
- **Types**: Specify the context of files and other resources.  
- **Classes**: Identify the object type (e.g., file, socket, etc.).  
- **Permissions**: Define the specific actions a process can perform on an object.  

### Security Benefits:  
Permissions are hardened with each Android release, reducing the system's attack surface.  

### Example Policy Rule:  
```
allow appdomain app_data_file:file rw_file_perms;
```
